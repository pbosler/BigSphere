This code is the product of Peter Bosler's Ph\+D thesis from the university of Michigan \cite{BoslerPhD}.

L\+P\+P\+M currently may be used to solve incompressible flow problems on the plane (with free boundary conditions) and on the sphere, where the incompressible fluid equations are better known as the barotropic vorticity equations. Current examples are primarily related to applications of weather and climate modeling.

See the included \hyperlink{README_8md}{R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md} file for more information.

Journal articles including results from L\+P\+P\+M computations include \cite{BoslerEtAl2014} and \cite{LauritzenResults}.
